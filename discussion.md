# Discussion
Welcome to life on the other side of the classroom! In pairs, you are responsible for leading discussion for 30 minutes of class. Discussion dates will be assigned the second week of class. 

From the list below and your own research, select two articles for the class to read and discuss. 

You are encouraged to match a scholarly article with a news article or blog post on a similar topic. Articles must be approved one week prior to discussion.

You are responsible for generating questions and leading discussion for 30 minutes. Be creative! Think about the types of classroom experiences that you have useful or exciting.
