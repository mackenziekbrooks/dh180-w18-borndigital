# Theimer
> Easy access to technology has given people across the world many more opportunities to document themselves, and to share that information with others, than ever before.

# Theimer
> Social media, or liquid communication, gives people a platform to share information about everyday events, and ones of historic importance as well, and consequently the question of how to best preserve those records has been an issue of archival concern for some time. 

# Rumsey
> Culture is far more efficient than biology. (23)

# Rumsey
> Culture mediates all of our experiences simply by providing each of us the basic template or mental model by which we interpret the world. (25)

# Sauter
> Digital reminiscence systems require the creation of digital memory objects, and prod us algorithmically to create specific kinds of digital memory objects, those that are algorithmically recognizable and categorizable, as part of their functionality.

# Haskins
