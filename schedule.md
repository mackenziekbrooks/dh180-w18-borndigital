# Course requirements:
## Participation/engagement (30%)
* Attendance and participation (10%). Students are expected to be active, prepared members of this seminar. Willingness to engage with unfamiliar concepts and technology is essential. Unexcused absences will reduce your grade by one percentage point. 
* Lead one class discussion (10%). From a provided list and your own research, select two articles for the class to read and discuss. You are encouraged to match a scholarly article with a news article or blog post on a similar topic. You are responsible for generating questions and leading discussion for 20 minutes. Discussion dates will be assigned the first week of class. Articles must be approved one week prior to discussion. 
* Lab reports (10%). Each week we will experiment with web archiving tools and related technologies during lab time. You will be required to submit a brief lab report with the results of the in-class exercises. 

## Paper 1 (10%)
Your personal archive (3-4 pages). What is in your personal archive? What kind of story do your digital artifacts tell? What physical records to do you produce, keep, and discard? Of the digital records you create, what survives? How does social media lose or preserve memories? And, as Molly Sauter writes in “Instant Recall,” “how do we remember when apps never forget?” In this paper, you will to track, document, reflect, and speculate on your personal archival record and its effect on your personal and collective memory.  

## Paper 2 (10%)
Collection processing plan (3-4 pages). In order to gain a solid grounding in the basics of archival principles, you will be given the opportunity to process an archival collection in Leyburn Library’s Special Collections and Archives. In small groups, you will be asked to document the physical and intellectual qualities of the collection. How is it organized? Does it need conservation? Who are the major people involved? What is the provenance? How should the materials be described? What use might it be to researchers? 

## Born Digital Archive Project (50%)

### Annotated Bibliography
Born digital archives annotated bibliography. Review 4-5 existing born digital archives through the lens of your chosen discipline. Annotations should be a substantial paragraph and follow the citation style of your discipline.

### Proposal
In one page, describe the topic and goals of the born digital archive you wish to build. What websites or other content do you wish to include? How will it be useful to future scholars? What permissions or privacy concerns do you need to consider? What web archiving applications will you use? How will you make the collection accessible?

#### Born digital archives creation 
Using the tools we have learned in class (Archive-it, Twarc, or others), create a focused archive of born digital content. The final product will vary depending on your topic, but it should include: 1) the digital files you are preserving 2) documentation on how to use the archive 3) potential research questions or example queries 4) thorough metadata 5) attribution to content creators and 6) a plan for the continual preservation of the archives. Portions of this project will be completed during lab time.

### Project reflection 
In 2-3 pages, reflect on your experience in this course, including any changed perceptions or behaviors relating to your own archival record. Are you going to save your tweets or delete them? Are there steps you can take to document and preserve the communities around you? How has your relationship with technology changed?
 
### Presentation
Each student will be asked to give a 10 minute presentation on their born digital archive.
