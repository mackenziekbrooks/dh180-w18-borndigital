# Discussion leading

Welcome to life on the other side of the classroom! In pairs, you are responsible for leading discussion for 30-45 minutes of class. Discussion dates will be assigned the third week of class. [Signup will happen in Box](https://wlu.box.com/s/hyseo1nkbnxp1wmlepbtspklqqthehut).

From the list below and your own research, select 1-2 articles for the class to read and discuss. 

You are encouraged to match the scheduled course readings with a news article or blog post on a similar topic. Articles must be approved one week prior to discussion.

You are responsible for generating questions and leading discussion for 30 minutes. Here are some suggestions:
* Be creative! Think about the types of classroom experiences that you have useful or exciting. 
* Allow for multiple learning styles. Some students talk to think, while others prefer time to process ideas to themselves or through writing. 
* Decide on a structure for discussion. Whole group, small groups? Is this a debate? A scavenger hunt?
* Don't be afraid of silence! 

Here are a few guides for leading discussion:
