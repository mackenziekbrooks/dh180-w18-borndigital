# Access
> "Preservation is about access in the future." Owens, pg 104.

> "This kind of discoverability of content is transformative. This would have been the stuff of science fiction before the web made it a mundane part of our everyday life. However, this kind of discoverability requires us to be considerably more thoughtful than we have been in the past about the kinds of effects that this sort of immediate access to information can have." Owens, pg 106
