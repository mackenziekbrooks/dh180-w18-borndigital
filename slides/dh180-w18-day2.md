1. Claim your axiom by commenting on the bold text.
2. Interrogate your axiom. What don't you understand? Annotate with questions.

# Owens's 3 frames
1. Divide into groups of five. 
2. Each team gets a frame: artifactual, informational, folkloric. You're responsible for interpreting your frame for the rest of the class.
3. Read your section. Discuss. Come up with alternate examples.
4. Make a website?
