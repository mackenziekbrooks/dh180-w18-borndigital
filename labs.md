# Labs

## Lab 1 // Environment setup // January 9

### Box
Did you know that W&L offers unlimited cloud storage while you're a student? We will use http://box.wlu.edu/ for assignment delivery and other course materials. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the platform.

The easiest way to use Box is to download Box Drive. This makes your Box folders act like another folder on your computer. Download here: https://www.box.com/resources/downloads/drive

### Text editors

Microsoft Word or Google Drive are great apps for writing papers. They make it easy to style and present a document. However, to work with text in a programmatic way, or to write code, we need a different app. MS Word adds a lot of hidden styling and other baggage that we don't need. One of the best features of text editors is that they can detect what language you're writing in and highlight the elements in different colors.

There are a lot of [options](http://lifehacker.com/five-best-text-editors-1564907215) for text editors. You're welcome to try on a few before choosing. I use [Atom](http://atom.io/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), so I recommend you install it for consistency.

### Hypothes.is
[Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) is a new framework for open annotation of the web. It operates via a Chrome extension allowing you to make private and public comments on websites. I have set up a private group for our course as there will be some readings that we annotate as a group.

### Zotero
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a citation manager. It operates via a browser plugin so you can capture citation information directly from the web. There is also a standalone desktop app ([and text mining possibilities!](http://papermachines.org/)) as well. There's even a plug-in for MS Word that will automatically generate your bibliography.


## Lab 2 // HTML + CSS // January 9
For these exercises, you will need to a text editor and a brower other than Safari.
