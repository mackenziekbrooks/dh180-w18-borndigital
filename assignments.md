# Assignments

Unless otherwise noted, all assignments will turned in via Box. Grades will be delivered through Sakai.

## Participation/engagement \(30%\)

* Attendance and participation \(10%\). Students are expected to be active, prepared members of this seminar. Willingness to engage with unfamiliar concepts and technology is essential. Unexcused absences will reduce your grade by one percentage point. 
* Lead one class discussion \(10%\). In pairs, you are responsible for leading discussion for 30 minutes of class. Discussion dates will be assigned the second week of class. See [Discussion](discussion.md) for more.
* Lab reports \(10%\). Each week we will experiment with web archiving tools and related technologies during lab time. You will be required to submit a brief lab report with the results of the in-class exercises. See [Labs](labs.md) for more details.

## Paper 1: Your Personal Archive \(10%\)

What is in your personal archive? What kind of story do your digital artifacts tell? What physical records to do you produce, keep, and discard? Of the digital records you create, what survives? How does social media lose or preserve memories? And, as Molly Sauter writes in “Instant Recall,” “how do we remember when apps never forget?” In this paper, you will to track, document, reflect, and speculate on your personal archival record and its effect on your personal and collective memory. This is an exploratory paper, so questions are encouraged, but you should still seek some kind of conclusion through thoughtful analysis and reflection.

For instance, if someone inventoried my home, they would find several boxes of printed, annotated journal articles from college and grad school. What does this say about me as a person? As a librarian? While deep psychoanalysis isn't necessary, what would a historian write? What _could_ a historian write? Is there enough to tell the story of your life or are their major life events or facets of yourself that are missing from the objects you might leave behind.

* 1 point for on time delivery of assignment. Save to your Box folder.
* 1 point for appropriate filename \(no spaces, includes last name, includes date, includes assignment identifier\).
* 1 point for appropriate length and formatting \(4 pages, MLA 8, 1 inch margins, double-spaced, 12 point font\). 
* 1 point for absence of major typos, grammatical errors, and unclear writing.
* 1 point for clear structure - think intro, conclusion, and topic sentences.
* 1 point for surveying your physical or print archive. Imagine inventorying your belongings for insurance reasons. What do you have at school? At home? Do you collect anything? Do you keep ephemera or throw it away \(movie tickets, postcards, etc.\)
* 1 point for surveying your digital archive. Go beyond the files on your hard drive. What accounts \(social media or otherwise\) do you have? Can you download your account data? Do you delete emails or save them? Do you keep backups?
* 1 point for reflecting on the effect of this archive on your memory. What is the effect of "outsourcing the contents of our minds to ... objects" \(Rumsey 1\)? 
* 1 point for speculating on the future life of this material. What will you bring to your first apartment? What will you still have if your phone died right now? What will you show your kids?
* 1 point for incorporating an external source in a meaningful way. Don't use external sources to speak for you, rather use it as evidence for your own idea or to prompt your own analysis.   

## Paper 2: Collection Encounter \(10%\)

In order to gain a solid grounding in the basics of archival principles, you will be given the opportunity to encounter an archival collection in Leyburn Library’s Special Collections and Archives. In small groups, you will be asked to document the physical and intellectual qualities of the collection. Take some time to review the collection before digging into the assignment. I recommend taking notes on paper or in a shared document. Your group can divide up the questions or answer based on everyone's notes.  


You should address the following questions \(.5 points each\): 

* What is this collection? (Give a basic inventory, remarking on anything especially unique or notable.)
* What is the extent \(often expressed in linear feet\)? 
* What type of material does it contain?
* How is the condition of the material? Has it been well-preserved? Does it need preservation/conservation? How can you tell?
* How is it organized? Does the order appear to be original? How can you tell? 
* What is the provenance? 
* Who are the creators? How much can you learn from the material itself vs. secondary research? Are there voices missing from the story this collection tells?
* Check out the finding aid online at archivesspace.wlu.edu. Is the description complete? Does it need improvement? 
* Who might find this collection useful? 
* Think back to Cook. How does this collection serve as evidence? As memory?

* 1 point for on time delivery of assignment. Save to your Box folder.
* 1 point for appropriate filename \(no spaces, includes last name, includes date, includes assignment identifier\).
* 1 point for appropriate length and formatting \(4-5 pages, MLA 8, 1 inch margins, double-spaced, 12 point font\).

## Born Digital Archive Project \(50%\)

### Annotated Bibliography

Born digital archives annotated bibliography. Review 4-5 existing born digital archives through the lens of your chosen discipline. Annotations should be a substantial paragraph and follow the citation style of your discipline.

### Proposal

In one page, describe the topic and goals of the born digital archive you wish to build. What websites or other content do you wish to include? How will it be useful to future scholars? What permissions or privacy concerns do you need to consider? What web archiving applications will you use? How will you make the collection accessible?

### Born digital archives creation

Using the tools we have learned in class \(Archive-it, Twarc, or others\), create a focused archive of born digital content. The final product will vary depending on your topic, but it should include: 1\) the digital files you are preserving 2\) documentation on how to use the archive 3\) potential research questions or example queries 4\) thorough metadata 5\) attribution to content creators and 6\) a plan for the continual preservation of the archives. Portions of this project will be completed during lab time.

### Project reflection

In 2-3 pages, reflect on your experience in this course, including any changed perceptions or behaviors relating to your own archival record. Are you going to save your tweets or delete them? Are there steps you can take to document and preserve the communities around you? How has your relationship with technology changed?

### Presentation

Each student will be asked to give a 10 minute presentation on their born digital archive.
